For the most part, around 80% of Afrikaans vocabulary is the same as Dutch: the difference is similar to Southern American English vs British Recieved Pronunciation. 

There are some simplified grammar and spelling differences, as well as regional vocabulary from disused Dutch words or foreign loanwords. However, there are false cognates where words have shifted considerably in meaning between the two, such as "amper": 'just barely' in Dutch, but 'almost' in Afrikaans.

## Spelling

For the most part, spelling gets simplified and matches pronunciation in Afrikaans.

## Notable Words

* `de`/`die`
* `Schip`/`Skip`
* `bommenwerper`/`bomwerper`
* `hoofdvloot`/`hoofvloot` - Vloot remains used for "fleet".

## Exceptions

* `lucht`/`lug` - An inherited Dutch spelling with the fossilized `cht`, instead of `g`. Left only for legacy purposes in military spelling: though given the prevalance of [`lughawe`](https://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lughawe_Londen-Heathrow), maybe we should feel safe in converting it.

Words more common in Afrikaans wikipedia is preferred over less common terms from Dutch: especially if it is unknown to Afrikaans vocabulary.
