		<Getmes>Good morning!\nI'm Hayasui, an oiler equipped with seaplanes!\nI'll do my best to support everyone!</Getmes>
		<Sinfo>Fleet escort oiler, Hayasui. Best regards!\nI'm a multi-purpose refuel vessel that can supply a variety of different materials and am also designed to carry carrier-based aircraft. With a change of plans after the Battle of Midway, I also became able to launch Ryuusei.</Sinfo>

		<Getmes>I'm Shoukaku, the first of the Shoukaku-class carriers.\nAlongside Zuikaku as remodeled Shoukaku-class, I'm hoping to be a useful source of strength for the admiral.</Getmes>
		<Sinfo>I'm Shoukaku, the first ship in the Shoukaku carrier series.\nI was designed and built as the first purpose-built large regular carrier to serve after the Washington Treaty was renounced. With my sister Zuikaku, we make the fifth carrier division. Following the tragedy, we followed in the footsteps of our seniors and continued to support the front lines. And now, having gotten over Mariana, I wish to continue taking a leap forward with the admiral.</Sinfo>

		<Getmes>The carrier whose rigging was completely modernized, Zuikaku here.\nDon't confuse me for your average aircraft carrier!</Getmes>
		<Sinfo>Second of the Shoukaku-class aircraft carriers, Zuikaku.\nFollowing the battle of Midway, I occupied a core position in the First Mobile Fleet along with Shoukaku-nee. I fought until the very last arrow was fired... which was literally the day the Mobile Fleet was completely annihilated. ...However, this time will be different! I will show you the strength and potential of a fully remodeled aircraft carrier! Shoukaku-nee, let's do this!</Sinfo>

		<Getmes>Hi! I am the Iowa-class battleship, Iowa.\nYou're the admiral of this fleet? Hmm... not bad!\nThe pleasure is all mine!</Getmes>
		<Sinfo>Hi! I'm the name ship of the Iowa-class battleships, Iowa. Although I'm a high-speed battleship, I'm heavily armed, and could be said to be the penultimate form of battleship. As the last of the battleship classes born in the USA, I will work hard for the fleet. Take good care of me!</Sinfo>

		<Getmes>Mr. Admiral, thanks for the hard work.\nTraining cruiser, Kashima, checking in! Ufufu!</Getmes>
		<Sinfo>Second of the Katori-class training cruisers—the little sister, Kashima. I was built at a time of peaceful waters in order to raise a new generation of capable fleet ships. The time spent on my original duty wasn't long, but I gave my very best both as a fleet flagship and escort. After the battle ended, for the sake of the future, I worked very hard! Please don't forget about my services, okay?</Sinfo>
